## Overview
Ozbargain is one of the most popular sites visited in Australia. It's a community based website featuring user generated content. Bargain hunters and savvy shoppers take part by sharing, upvoting/downvoting and commenting on deals they or others have found.

## Problem
It is 2013 and the website still looked like it has never been updated since the "Web 2.0" style was the trend. As a designer, I couldn't have this and decided it would be a fun personal side-project to give it a little makeover, as well as fix some of the nagging issues I had with the site's navigation.

As the website is powered by user generated content, it is imperative that the website promotes its account registration. It's also important to make the user feel like they're part of the community, which would make them more inclined to participate.

Once logged in, there's no way of displaying if you had any notifications. The logged-in state needed personality so that the user feels like they *own* the account.

The header menu needed to be cleaned up as a lot of it is repeated if you hovered over `Deals`. The categories were already displayed underneath the main header menu, so this is redundant.

## Solution
The site already had logic built into it where it shows the most up-voted deals higher up, however the old design never communicates this to the user. You could only access it via the `Deals` menu in the old design, I simply reorganised those links and placed them under the main header. I felt that this is more user friendly for new users as they're able to filter deals that *they want to see*.

As mentioned earlier, I wanted the user to feel like they *owned* their account. I felt that I achieved this by having their display picture shown prominently on the top right corner of the header. If the user had any notifications, it would make sense to also have this appear near their display picture.

The rest of the page just needed some cleaning up. I maintained the colours used in the original, but made the menu the dark grey so as to not detract from the main content of the site.  Added the orange brand colour to the title links and added tags next to them so that users are able to identify at a glance if a deal is marked `new`, `expired`, `freebie` etc. I updated the logo in Illustrator to be more modern and aligned with the new design.

## Thoughts & Conclusion
Overall I am quite pleased with the results. I didn't want to spend too long on it so I only made the main top half of the site. I sent it to the site owner, Scotty as a form of a fan mail and he replied to me informing he liked it and would steal some ideas! I'd like to think that I had a part in some of the new site elements & features today ;)
