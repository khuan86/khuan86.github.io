Note: This is an ongoing project that is currently a work-in-progress. I used Balsamiq for my wireframes and have begun recreating in Figma.

### Overview
As you can imagine, the customer service reps already have most of their hands full while they're on the phone with customers; they desperately need a better system so that they are able to assist their customers in a quick and efficient manner. It was a no-brainer that this admin section was going to be the first problem to tackle.

### Filters
I added a more powerful filter where not only Customer Service Reps could use, but also the Marketing team. A use case example  may be that Marketing might want to run a campaign on customers who pay via AfterPay, or customers who reside in a particular delivery zone, or simply customers who have only made one order. They can easily create the filter, export the results and even save the filter with their parameters for future use.

### Customer Details
In the Customer detail page, I wanted to add more information that is easily digestable. At a glance, you could see what kind of customer you are looking at; based on their average order value, their Sift score (Fraud) as well as their basic information. The user is also able to add their own tags for each individual order and add/view notes. I've added tabs to seperate other details as well as having the benefit of scalability.

### Thoughts
I am really enjoying this project as I just love designing solutions that will impact all aspects of the business, as well as their customers. So far, the stakeholders are just as excited and share the same passion to really make this Admin overhaul a success, and I'm happy they allow me to really push the limits by adding a ton of new functionality.

I'm also very keen and excited to learn Figma with this project and I can see why the Design community are starting to switch over to Figma over Sketch!
