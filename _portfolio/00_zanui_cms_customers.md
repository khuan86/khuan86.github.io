Note: This is an ongoing project that is currently a work-in-progress. I have quickly mocked my ideas in Balsamiq (as shown) and have begun recreating in Figma.

### Overview
I was tasked with redesigning Zanui's Admin CMS page, with a focus on the customer database module. As you can imagine, the customer service reps already have most of their hands full while they're on the phone with customers, they urgently need a better system so that they can help their customers in a quick an efficient manner. It was obvious that this module was going to be the first problem to tackle of the Admin redesign.

### Filters
I added a more powerful filter where not only Customer Service Reps could use, but also the Marketing team. A use case example  may be that Marketing might want to run a campaign on customers who pay via AfterPay, or customers who reside in a particular delivery zone, or simply customers who have only made one order. They can easily create the filter, export the results and even save the filter with their parameters for future use.

### Customer Details
In the Customer information page, I wanted to add more information that is easily digestable. At a glance, you could see what kind of customer you are looking at, based on their average order value, their Sift score (Fraud) as well as their basic information. The user is also able to add their own tags for each individual order and add/view notes.
