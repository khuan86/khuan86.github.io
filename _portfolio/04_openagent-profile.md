## Problem
The old design of the profile page had made too much use of a pale-green colour. It doesn't look appealing and in my opinion cheapens the brand. I also felt that the user had no relief/breathing space between all the different sections. It is overwhelming to look at as it was information overload. The tabs `Overview`, `Reviews` and `Properties` is quite lost and hard to find amongst all the other sections.

It was also strange that the page did not show the agent's name. This must've been overlooked upon as it is quite important information. The addition of the map is a good idea however I feel that by using the OpenAgent logo makes it look too cluttered.

It is a missed opportunity by not having any call-to-action buttons to contact this agent.

## Solution
It was initially briefed to just redesign the page to keep it inline with the new homepage with a couple of additions, however after redesigning it, I felt that I could do better and re-do the whole page. I sent them both versions and they preferred the one I came up with :)

My thoughts were, being an agent profile, you want the essential information appear at all times (as with the original). However having it be kept at the top took up too much valuable space for everything else. The tabs, as mentioned earlier was lost, so I moved it up where it can be seen quite prominently. With this, the agent's picture is displayed on the left where it can always be seen, as well as their name and easy access call-to-actions.

With the help of white space, the content overall looks more organised and coherent. It is easy to follow and information is easier to digest.
