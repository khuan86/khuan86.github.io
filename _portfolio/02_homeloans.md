## Problem
The goal of this landing page was quite simple: gather as much data as possible. However most landing pages you find on the internet look untrustworthy to provide them with your information. Many people are not willing to give out their information so freely, especially when it requires your phone number. People are becoming more and more aware of phone scams and are increasingly weary of providing such details online (as you should be!)

So the task itself seemed quite simple, but to get there requires good design-thinking to convince users that you *are* trustworthy!

## Solution

### UX
As mentioned, the landing page's main goal was to gather data from potential customers. I did not want to have too many distractions from that goal. The visual hierarchy of the page must be straight the point where the user knows exactly what they needed to do without *thinking* too much about it.

As soon as you land on the page, you will see the form smack bang in the middle; no distractions. If the user wanted to learn more, they can either scroll down or click on the links above (which serves the same purpose since it is all on one page). They were mainly there to support the trust I wanted to build. Information should be easy to find, else you risk making the page look "fishy". The idea was to have this "top-section" of the webpage fill the entire browser.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/eg-contactus.png" caption="Having `Contact Us` and `Our Company` on the the top right reassures the user that the homeloans.com.au brand is real and if they prefer, contact them instead of being contacted." &}

The visual hierarchy is important in this landing page as you need to meet the business requirements, however this is only half of the equation, as the design aspect is just as important since you need to *convince* them that you are legit and not out to scam them. On the surface it looks quite simple, but you need a good balance between meeting business goals, as well as good design to achieve it!

### Design
As I needed to design the banner ad as well, I started with this first since this is what the user will see before the landing page. The banner ad must pique their interest, as well as look trustworthy enough for them to engage.

I did not want anything complicated or fancy. We see enough ads these days where we kind of just look past them. I have the advantage that the ad will appear on home loan comparison sites so I knew the audience would already be interested in home loans. Now I just need to convince them to click!

I put myself in the audience's shoes and thought back to when I was looking at home loans. It was daunting and I had no idea where to start. I was so relieved when I found out that that having a broker take care of almost everything (so many paperwork and so many home loan companies to choose from!). Armed with this knowledge, I began searching for stock photos that captured what it looks like to have someone professional help you. These were the main requirements that the picture should capture: calm, stress-free, professional, hassle-free. Looking for the exact photo that you envisioned is time consuming and hard, arguably harder than the design itself :)

The client gave me creative freedom for this project. This included copywriting. Having found the perfect picture that captured the *moment* I wanted, I just needed supporting text to accompany the *vision* I wanted the user to have. I came up with `Compare homeloans with a mortgage broker today!` I just needed something short and snappy. The call-to-action button needed to get the user to engage. Everybody loves free right? You'd be surprised that many people do not know that mortgage brokers are free (banks pay them commission). My call-to-action text reads `Get your free consultation now`. 

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/eg-cta.png" caption="Using the action words: `Get` with `free` achieves two purpose: informing the user that it's a free service and gets them to engage by clicking. Two birds with one stone!" &}

Half of the battle is won once the user is on the landing-page. Now to convince them to part with their information. This page is where I needed to *really* convince them!

Here I wanted the user to feel that the process of getting a consultation with a broker to be as easy as possible. Again, I wanted to the user to envision themselves to be stress-free. I found an image of a man talking on the phone looking quite relaxed and happy. The image I found is exactly the image I want them to envision themselves in. Having the image take up the full width of the browser serves as a constant reminder

The next line reaffirms the action I want the user to take, as well as inform them of the expected outcome: `Simply enter your details and we will contact you`.

As for colours, blue is known psychologically to be a trustworthy colour. I used this in the call-to-action button. It has a calming, trusting and non-disruptive feel to it. The background images in both the banner ad and landing page were slightly blurred and had a subtle colour overlay so as to not distract but also be there to support the goal. The homeloans logo is prominently in the top-middle and informational links is easy to find. Psychologically, using images of real people, rather than cartoons or drawings gives the image of trust.
